###      advantage of using CNN over ANN for image classification even though can solve image classification using ANN

1.  Feedforward neural networks can learn a single feature representation of image but in case of complex images, ANN will fail to give better
predictions, this is because it cannot learn pixel dependencies present in images
2.  CNN can learn multiple layers of feature representations of an image by applying filters or transformations
3.  In CNN, number of parameters for network to learn is significantly lower than multilayer neural networks since number of units in network decreases
therefore reducing chance of overfitting
4.  CNN considers context information in small neighborhood and due to this feature, these are very important to achieve a better prediction in data
like images, Since digital images are a bunch of pixels with high values, it makes sense to use CNN to analyze them, CNN decreases their values which is
better for training phase with less computational power and less information loss
