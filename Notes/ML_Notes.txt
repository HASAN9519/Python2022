###      Ensemble: What is Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)?

# Bootstrap aggregating also called bagging is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve stability and accuracy of machine learning
# algorithms used in statistical classification and regression 

# In machine learning hyperparameter optimization or tuning is problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm; A
# hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control learning process; By contrast, values of other parameters (node weights) are learned

# curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in
# low-dimensional settings such as three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience

# Gradient boosting is typically used with decision trees (especially CART trees) of a fixed size as base learners, For this special case Friedman
# proposes a modification to gradient boosting method which improves quality of fit of each base learner

# XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework, In prediction problems involving
# unstructured data (images, text) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks

# Pareto Distribution (power law probability distribution, talks about 80-20 rule i.e. 80% of outcomes are result of 20% causes)
# Converting pareto distribution to normal distribution using box cox transformation, it converts to nearly normal distribution, formula is: 
x_new = log(x_old) if lambda = 0
x_new = (x_old**lambda - 1)/lambda otherwise)

# to Check if distribution is normal gaussian distribution or not: Draw QQ plots (Quantile-Quantile plot) where drawing actual quantiles for data and
# theoretical quantiles and then look at deviation
# Normal distribution with mean 0 and std 1
# for Right Skewed plot or distribution: mean > median > mode
# for Left Skewed plot or distribution: mode > median > mean

###      Difference between fit_transform and transform
# fit_transform do two operations on input data in one go which are fit transformer as per calculations on input data and then apply those calculations
# to input data but transform will only apply calculations on input data as per transformer

###      When to use fit_predict and what is it
# fit_predict fits model as per input data and later on make a prediction as well using trained model, generally used in clustering algorithms like
# DBSCAN where only fit_predict or fit can be used, Predict is not possible there

###      difference between standardization and normalization
# Normalization is process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range, Typical normalizations include scaling variable so 
# variable average is 0, scaling variable so variance is 1 or scaling variable so variable values range from 0 to 1
1. Normalization is basically min max scaling
2. Values belong to [0,1] or [-1,1]
3. Affected by outliers
4. Useful when don't know about distribution 

# Standardization is process of transforming data into a common format which allows researcher to make meaningful comparison
1. Standardization converts data in a manner that mean of transformed data is 0 and std=1
2. No bound on values
3. Not much affected by outliers
4. Useful when data distribution is normal gaussian distribution

# Data Wrangling is process of converting data from initial format to a format that may be better for analysis
# Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into discrete categorical 'bins' for grouped analysis

###      Correlation and Causation

# Correlation: a measure of extent of interdependence between variables
# Causation: relationship between cause and effect between two variables

# It is important to know difference between these two and that correlation does not imply causation, Determining correlation is much simpler than
# determining causation as causation may require independent experimentation

# Pearson Correlation measures linear dependence between two variables X and Y
# resulting coefficient is a value between -1 and 1 inclusive, where:
1: Total positive linear correlation
0: No linear correlation, two variables most likely do not affect each other
-1: Total negative linear correlation

###      P-value

# P-value is probability value that determines correlation between two variables is statistically significant or not, Normally, if choose a significance
# level of 0.05 which means that 95% confident about correlation between variables is significant, By convention when:
p-value < 0.001, there is strong evidence that correlation is significant
p-value < 0.05, there is moderate evidence that correlation is significant
p-value < 0.1, there is weak evidence that correlation is significant
p-value > 0.1, there is no evidence that correlation is significant

###      ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test whether there are significant differences between means of two or more groups, ANOVA
# returns two parameters: 
F-test score: ANOVA assumes means of all groups are same, calculates how much actual means deviate from assumption and reports it as F-test score; A
larger score means there is a larger difference between means
P-value: P-value tells how statistically significant is calculated score value

###      Residual Plot

# A good way to visualize variance of data is to use a residual plot, difference between observed value (y) and predicted value (Yhat) is called
# residual (e), looking at a regression plot residual is distance from data point to fitted regression line
# A residual plot is a graph that shows residuals on vertical y-axis and independent variable on horizontal x-axis, should pay attention at spread of
# residualsto when looking at a residual plot, If points in a residual plot are randomly spread out around x-axis then a linear model is appropriate for
# data because Randomly spread out residuals means that variance is constant and thus linear model is a good fit for this data

###      Ridge regression 

# Ridge regression is a regression that is employed in a Multiple regression model when Multicollinearity occurs, Multicollinearity is when there is a
# strong relationship among independent variables, Ridge regression is very common with polynomial regression, Ridge regression is used to regularize
# and reduce standard errors to avoid over-fitting a regression model

###      Data Visualization

# Dark Horse Analytics states 3 best practices for creating a visual: Less is more effective, Less is more attractive, Less is more impactive
# There are three different layers in architecture of matplotlib which are following: Backend Layer, Artist layer and Scripting layer
# Artist layer allows full control and fine-tuning of Matplotlib top-level container for all plot elements

# can modify a figure after it is rendered using notebook backend
# Matplotlib magic functions are: %matplotlib notebook, %matplotlib inline

# A line chart or line plot is a type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line 
# segments; It is a basic type of chart common in many fields; Use line plot for a continuous data set; These are best suited for trend-based
# visualizations of data over a period of time

# Area plots are stacked by default; to produce a stacked area plot, each column must be either all positive or all negative values (any NaN i.e. not a
# number, values will default to 0); To produce an unstacked plot set parameter stacked to value False

# A histogram is a way of representing frequency distribution of numeric dataset; it works by partitioning x-axis into bins, assigns each data point in
# dataset to a bin and then counts number of data points that have been assigned to each bin; So y-axis is frequency or number of data points in each
# bin; can change bin size and usually one needs to tweak it so that distribution is displayed nicely

# A bar plot is a way of representing data where length of bars represents magnitude/size of feature/variable; Bar graphs usually represent numerical
# and categorical variables grouped in intervals

# A pie chart is a circular graphic that displays numeric proportions by dividing a circle (or pie) into proportional slice

# A box plot is a way of statistically representing distribution of data through five main dimensions: 
Minimun: Smallest number in dataset
First quartile: Middle number between minimum and median
Second quartile (Median): Middle number of (sorted) dataset
Third quartile: Middle number between median and maximum
Maximum: Highest number in dataset

# A scatter plot (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other; Scatter plots look similar to line plots in that they both map 
# independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph; While data points are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a
# scatter plot; data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend; With further analysis using tools like regression, can mathematically calculate 
# this relationship and use it to predict trends outside dataset

# bubble plot is a variation of scatter plot that displays three dimensions of data (x, y, z); data points are replaced with bubbles and size of bubble
# is determined by third variable z also known as weight; In maplotlib, can pass in an array or scalar to parameter s to plot() that contains weight of
# each point

# A waffle chart is an interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals; It is commonly an effective option when
# trying to add interesting visualization features to a visual that consists mainly of cells such as an Excel dashboard; A Waffle chart is a great way
# to visualize data in relation to a whole or to highlight progress against a given threshold

# Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a
# speech, blog post, or database) bigger and bolder it appears in word cloud

# clustering markers, superimposed onto a map in Folium using a marker cluster object; In choropleth maps higher measurement of statistical variable 
# being displayed on map has brighter color



###      Plotly

# Plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 chart types; web based visualizations created using Plotly python can be
# displayed in Jupyter notebook, saved to standalone HTML files or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash; Plotly Graph Objects
# is low-level interface to figures, traces and layout whereas plotly express is a high-level wrapper for Plotly; Dash is an Open-Source User Interface 
# Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications; It is both enterprise-ready and a first-class member of Plotly’s open-source tools; Core
# and HTML are two components of dash; html component library has a component for every HTML tag; core component describe higher-level components that
# are interactive and are generated with JavaScript, HTML and CSS through React.js library; A callback function is a python function that is 
# automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes; Callback function is decorated with '@app.callback' decorator; Callback
# decorator function takes two parameters: Input and Output; Input and Output to callback function will have component id and component property;
# Multiple inputs or outputs should be enclosed inside either a list or tuple 

# plotly.express module (usually imported as px) contains functions that can create entire figures at once and is referred to as Plotly Express or PX
# Plotly Express is a built-in part of plotly library and is recommended starting point for creating most common figures
